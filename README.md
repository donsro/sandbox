### Portfolio and miscellaneous Javascript coding samples

Often times people ask me to provide my portfolio links or code samples from my recent projects on job interviews. This may not be an easy task to do. I may have no access nor legal rights to share the code that is someone else's proprietary software. Feel free to browse around my GitHub repositories. These are my [code testing samples and experiments] (http://donsro.atwebpages.com/sandbox/index.html). Nothing is copy-pasted. All original. As a part of my portfolio I would also like to represent a few web projects that I was heavily involved with as a Front-end web developer / designer in the past.

 - [widereurope.eu] (http://www.widereurope.eu) -  Key role in creation, maintenance, training and management of Wider Europe website.
 - [whattoexpect.com] (http://www.whattoexpect.com)  - Front end development. Worked on slideshow and photolist article layout.
 - [spafinder.com] (http://www.spafinder.com)  - Front end development. Worked on main website's navigation design and implementation, other modules.
 - [ml.com] (https://www.ml.com) - Prototype development.
